<h2>The earliest example of a Western end-blown flute was discovered in 2008 at Hohle Fels cave near Ulm, Ger. The flute, made from the bone of a griffin vulture, has five finger holes and measures about 8.5 inches (22 cm) long. It is thought to be at least 35,000 years old. Discoveries elsewhere in southwestern Germany yielded other flutes thought to be of similar age.
    The characteristic flute of Western music is the transverse flute held sideways to the right of the player. It was known in ancient Greece and Etruria by the 2nd century BCE and was next recorded in India, then China and Japan, where it remains a leading wind instrument. In the 16th century the tenor flute, pitched in G, was played in consort with descant and bass flutes (pitched in D and C respectively). All were typically of boxwood with six finger holes and no keys, semitones being made by cross-fingering (uncovering the holes out of sequence), and retained the cylindrical bore of their Asiatic bamboo relatives. These 16th-century flutes were made obsolete late in the 17th century by the one-keyed conical flute, probably conceived by the celebrated Hotteterre family of makers and players in Paris. A conical flute is made in separate joints, the head joint being cylindrical, the others contracting toward the foot. Two joints were common in the 18th century, the upper being supplied in alternate lengths for tuning purposes. The instrument was known then as the flauto traverso, traversa, or German flute, as distinct from the common flute, usually called the recorder.
